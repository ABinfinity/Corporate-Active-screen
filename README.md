# Corporate-Active-screen

In today's crucial WFH environment most of us had to keep our screen ON in order to be visible to our supervisor.

I checked out many alternatives online, from hardware as well as software perspective.
And if your office system doesn't let you change your settings or install any third party software, then this is your catch.

Given VBscript will send automated key strokes at a certain interval of time in order to keep that active symbol intact.
In order to kill this script:- 
1) Place the kill switch file on your preferred location. (You can remove first letter of file while running the script, and place it back when you want to stop it.)
2) You can stop it directly from task manager, operation will be under the name of "Windows Based Script Host".
